# 🌌 Premium Task Tracker

A high-end, dark-themed Task Management application built with a focus on **Glassmorphism** aesthetics and seamless user experience. This project was developed as a Full-Stack assignment using pure Vanilla technologies.



## 🎯 Overview
The Premium Task Tracker allows users to organize their daily goals within a sophisticated "Deep Midnight" interface. Unlike basic todo apps, this version prioritizes UI/UX, featuring smooth transitions, persistent data, and a dedicated scrollable task panel.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Aesthetic Dark Mode**: A premium UI inspired by modern dashboard designs (Inter font, neon accents, and blur effects).
* **LocalStorage Persistence**: Tasks are saved locally in the browser. Refreshing or closing the tab will not lose your data.
* **Smart Task Panel**: A separate, scrollable container that handles overflow gracefully, keeping your workspace tidy.
* **Interactive Stats**: Real-time counter for pending tasks and an automated date display.
* **Keyboard Friendly**: Add tasks instantly using the `Enter` key.
* **Full CRUD Logic**: Create, Read, Update (Toggle Status), and Delete tasks effortlessly.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
* **CSS3**: Advanced styling including `backdrop-filter`, custom scrollbars, and CSS variables.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Functional programming for data state management and DOM manipulation.
